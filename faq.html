        <summary>Do I need to have a didactic certificate to apply for a position as lecturer?</summary>
        <p class="text">A didactic certificate or teacher training certificate is not always necessary. We do, however,
          like to work with people who have work experience at university or master’s level in the professional
          practice. Are you going to work with us as a lecturer for a longer period? Then you will have to follow an
          internal training programme. During this programme you can obtain a didactic certificate.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to have a master’s degree to apply for a teaching position?</summary>
        <p class="text">In most cases, a completed master’s or university education is indeed a requirement. This will
          be stated in the job description. Have you almost completed your master’s degree? Then you may already apply.
          For several vacancies, a completed HBO education is sufficient. We may expect you to obtain a master’s degree
          in due course. Moreover, as a new HZ lecturer, you must always follow our internal training programme.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I become a lecturer next to my current job?</summary>
        <p class="text">Depending on the vacancy, this is certainly an option. We believe it is important to provide our
          students with case histories from the professional practice. This is possible because some of our lecturers
          have and keep having recent work experience. For example, in the form of a job or running an own company.</p>
