			<h2>WHY ICT ?</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I have
				always dreamed of becoming a Computer Engineer and helping give back to my country and I believe
				that after completing the bachelor degree in Information and Communication Technology from HZ
				University of Applied Sciences would set me miles ahead to reaching my goal.</p>
			<p>Information and Communication Technology is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become an
				integral part of the world that we live in today. ICT can lead to exciting career opportunities across a
				range of industries. I always think about the benevolent side of ICT and the work professionals in this
				field are trying to make the world a better place. My Passion for study in Information and Communication
				Technology started when I was in tenth grade. I
				vividly remember after completing my Secondary School I created my new Facebook and Twitter
				account and I was wondering how these kinds of websites actually work! </p>
			<p>ICT gives the opportunity to have excellent knowledge about the merge of Information with software
				engineering, technology, media design and so on. It also gives the opportunity to the students to
				develop themselves as a high-level Artificial Intelligence Expert, Cyber Expert, Web Expert and Software
				Developer in ICT Sectors. Combined with the knowledge I have garnered from my previous studies, I am
				very curious and flexible to complete my bachelor degree in ICT.</p>

				affordable for me. Studying ICT at hz University of Applied Sciences is an opportunity I would love to
				dedicate myself too wholeheartedly. I expect to have a developed and successful career that I can be
